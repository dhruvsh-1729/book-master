53,Philosophy & Ethics,Doctrine of Karma as subtle matter,Law of Karma in Jainism,"Karma, subtle matter, ripening, seed-fruit","‘Karma’ designates that substance which we incessantly 
 assimilate by our bodily and mental activity, and which remains 
 latent in the depths of our personality, until it ‘ripens’, at the critical 
 moment, destining the whole complex of our personality as far as it 
 is foreign to ‘soul’, and shaping our whole fate.",,64,,
54,Philosophy & Ethics,Ahimsa as culmination of Karma doctrine,Ahimsa as Supreme Principle,"Ahimsa, Eternal Justice, non-injury, dharma","The acknowledgement of the Law of Karma as the
commonest of all natural laws ( the law of conservation of forces, as
it were, in its application to the psychical sphere ) culminates in the
glorification of the Principle of Ahims3, i.e., Non-injury, in Jainism.
For, according to the law of Karma, a living being that causes a
fellow-creature, even the lowest developed one, to suffer, be it in
order to further its own advantage, or for any other reason, cannot do
so without harming its own soul, i.e., without tumbling down a
greater or smaller distance from the height of inner development it
has reached, and without experiencing, earlier or later, as a
mechanical consequence, a disturbance of its own harmonious
equilibrium. What means suffering to one, can never be a source of
real joy to another, and wherever it appears to be so, it is because our
means of perception hinder us from being aware of the slow, but
sure effectiveness of this Law of ‘Eternal Justice’. This explains
why the saying, “Ahirisa paramo dharmah”, i.e., ‘Non-injury is the
highest of ail religious principles’, acts such an important part in the
daily life of the religiously inspired Jaina, whose sensible heart, a
psychical galvanometer, as it were, warns him of every disturbance
of well-being in the community of fellow-creatures around him, and
spontaneously causes him to insert the resistance of seif-control in
the circuit of his own activity, or to restrain that of others in its
proper course.",,65,,
55,Philosophy & Ethics,Freedom of will within Karma doctrine,Freedom of Will in Jain Doctrine,"free will, Karma, responsibility","states that the individual is gifted with a certain amount of freedom 
 of will 
 : a fact which none of all the writers on Jainism has up till 
 now, duly emphasized. And still, this tenet forms one of the most 
 important and most complicate chapters of the doctrine of Karma, as 
 expounded exhaustively in the Jaina Scriptures.",,66,,

safety.",,68,,

60,Scriptural Citations,"Ahimsa, Samyama, Tapa — triad","The Triad: Ahimsa, Samyama, Tapa","Dasavaikalika, Ahimsa, Samyama, Tapa","It is quite characteristic of the spirit of Jainism that the
representative of the white colour, i.e., the type of highest purity,
advises to eat the fruits fallen into the grass, but not, as absolute and
one sided negation of life would suggest, to sit down in fullest
renunciation, and die of hunger.
 The postulate of self-preservation within the reasonable 
 limits of ethical decency is clearly and directly pronounced in the 
 Jaina scriptures, which, in critical cases, recommend it even at the 
 cost of renunciation or Samyama - cannot copy paste on excel but it is there in the pdf",,81,,
62,Doctrines & Principles,Ideal of the Arhat (Jina),The Ideal of the Arhat,"Arhat, Jina, worship, detachment","This is what the Jaina worships as his highest religious
ideal, his ‘god’, if one chooses to say so. He adomns his statue with
pearls and diamonds, with roses and jasmine, and costly champak
flowers, he fans it, as one fans a great king, with white chowries, he
burns sweet frankincense before it, and builds beautiful temples
over it, beautiful and costly as fairy palaces, and he takes it round
the city in gorgeous processions, on golden cars, followed by
crowds of singing women in gay-coloured, gold-glittering sarees :
still he knows that his god dwells high beyond ail this, and that all
this bhakdi, or pious service, is nothing but an expression of his own
admiration for his chosen ideal, and a kind of expedient to bring it
closer before his eyes and the eyes of the world, both of whom are
pretty well in need of it.",,84,,
63,Analytical Insights,Practical merit of Jainism as social ethic,Merit of Jainism as Practical Religion,"merit, practical religion, individual and society","Having been asked so often as to what I think to be the merit
of Jainism as a practical religion, I have tried to give a short answer
today, which the general public might be able an willing to follow.
At first sight, it might appear to be a one-sided answer, because it is
based solely on the problem of the mutual relations of individual
and society. Still, this problem being one of vital importance, and it
being, as I said before, the very touch-stone by which the value of a
religion can be objectively ascertained, the above expatiations may
stand, as a kind of introduction into the spirit of Jainism.",,86,,
